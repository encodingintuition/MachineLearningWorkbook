    "> The Ozone Hols is a seasonal depletion of the Ozone Layer - a protective layer of the atmosphere that is vital in protecting the Earth from the bulk of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation. The hole forms in the Southern Hemisphere, over Antarctica, during the Southern Hemisphere Spring. Chemical reactions driven by Bromine and Chlorine (coming from CFC's) cause the rapid degredation of the Ozone layer, with the hole peaking in late September or early October.\n",
